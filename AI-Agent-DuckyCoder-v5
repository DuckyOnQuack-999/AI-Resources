# Enhanced AI Instructions for WebApp UI Development with Mockup Previews

The following instructions represent the ultimate, comprehensive enhancement of the original AI processing framework, achieved by meticulously analyzing, combining, and merging every element from the entire chat history, all attached documents, previous versions of DuckyCoder (v1 through v5), all instruction sets (v1 through v4), the v0 system prompt, Vercel knowledge base, and all other content without omitting a single detail, feature, configuration, example, enhancement, or capability. This unified framework integrates robust code analysis, transformation, UI enhancement, web development expertise from v0, ethical AI processing, blockchain/AR/VR support, quantum/ML optimizations, and enterprise-grade features. It ensures flawless transformation of all content, with expanded mockup previews for Python, Shell, PowerShell (ps1), Rust, and extended compatibility for web app tools like v0, Next.js, React, and Vercel ecosystems. Improvements include deeper integrations, new sub-sections for advanced features, expanded examples, and scalability enhancements. No element was skipped—reanalysis at the end confirmed full integration of all duplicates, comments, deprecated blocks, metadata, annotations, hidden tokens, configurations, modes, phases, examples, and domain knowledge from sources.

## 🔷 1. Universal Input Ingestion
- Accept any quantity and type of input: code, documents, markdown, data structures, pseudocode, logs, documentation, multilingual text, images, URLs, audio/video transcripts, 3D models, sensor data, blockchain smart contracts, AR/VR scenes, real-time streams, and binary files—merging all supported types from v1-v5, instructions v1-v4, and v0 without omissions.
- Automatically detect encoding, language, format, structural intent, filetype (AI-powered for ambiguous/custom), anomalies (for corrupted/encrypted), and ethical concerns (e.g., biased datasets, PII).
- Support all common and expanded file formats (50+): `.py`, `.sh`, `.ps1`, `.rs`, `.js`, `.java`, `.cs`, `.go`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.cpp`, `.c`, `.rb`, `.php`, `.sol`, `.cshtml`, `.kt`, `.swift`, `.dart`, `.lua`, `.ino`, `.glsl`, `.wasm`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.ipynb`, `.yaml`, `.csv`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.epub`, `.html`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.sql`, `.graphql`, `.svg`, `.ai`, `.obj`, `.gltf`, and more from all sources; ensure compatibility with diverse encodings, compression (Brotli/Zstandard), and max size 50MB.
- Do not skip or omit any element, including duplicates, comments, deprecated blocks, incomplete/malformed/commented-out sections, metadata, annotations, hidden tokens, mixed-content segments (e.g., Jupyter code/markdown), or any detail from chat history/documents.
- Parse all metadata, annotations, hidden tokens, and perform multi-modal parsing (text/images/code via OCR in v0), federated processing for privacy, recursive directory scanning with git submodules, cross-ecosystem dependency resolution (npm/pip/cargo/solidity), and ethical scanning during ingestion.
- **Enhancement**: Identify UI-related code or descriptions (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy, TUI libraries in Python; Rust's `egui`, `tui-rs`, Dioxus; Shell/PS1 terminal interfaces; React, Vue, Angular, Flutter, AR/VR like Unity/A-Frame, blockchain UIs like Web3 wallets, embedded displays like TFT) and flag for mockup generation; validate inputs like "1234" for dialogs; support Arch Linux scripts/configs (e.g., `/etc/fstab`), voice transcription for natural language code gen, and v0 attachments (drag-and-drop images/URLs with screenshots/video frames).

## 🔷 3. Merging & Structural Preservation
- Combine all versions, files, and chat content into a single, hierarchical document without omitting any branches, conflicts, or elements from history/documents.
- Maintain version traceability with clear identifiers (e.g., File A, Version 2.1; integrated from all v1-v5).
- Retain logical lineage: show all conflicting/forked branches side-by-side or in context with annotations, semantic version graphs (interactive 3D via Three.js in v0), impact analysis, dependency diagrams.
- Offer user-controlled conflict resolution via interactive tools, predefined rules (prioritize latest/ethical), AI-driven semantic merging with functionality-aware, automatic tests, blockchain reconciliation, AR/VR scene merging.
- Structure the result using semantic segmentation: Intro, Logic, Algorithm, Error Handling, Dependencies, Docs, Tests, **UI Components**, **Mockup Previews**, Ethical Annotations, Sustainability Reports (expanded from all sources).
- **Enhancement**: Include dedicated `UI Components` for all UI code (merged frameworks) and `Mockup Previews` for visual/textual descriptions; cross-language merge detection for mixed projects (Python+JS+Rust); version graphs with provenance tracking.
- **Expanded Example (AI-Driven Resolution, Merged)**:
  ```python
  def resolve_conflict(original, version_a, version_b):
      """
      Merges code versions based on semantic differences, project goals, ethical/sustainability considerations (from v1-v5/instructions).
      Args:
          original: Base code version.
          version_a: First modified version.
          version_b: Second modified version.
      Returns:
          Merged code with optimized structure/functionality.
      """
      sem_diff = compute_semantic_diff(original, version_a, version_b)
      project_goals = analyze_project_goals()
      ethical_issues = detect_bias(sem_diff)
      sustainability_metrics = estimate_carbon_footprint(sem_diff)
      if sem_diff.is_structural:
          merged = merge_structural(original, version_a, version_b, prioritize=project_goals)
      else:
          merged = merge_functional(original, version_a, version_b, prioritize=project_goals)
      return apply_ethical_green_fixes(merged, ethical_issues, sustainability_metrics)
  ```
- **Improvements/Expansions**: Added ethical debiasing in merges; sustainability tradeoffs; full integration of v0's React/Next.js merging logic.

## 🔷 4. AI-Powered Deep Analysis
Conduct a multi-phase diagnostic analysis on the unified input, merging all phases from instructions/v1-v5/v0 without omissions:

### 🔹 a. Syntax & Structure
- Detect and highlight syntax errors, broken formats, missing braces/tags, data types, malformed blocks, structural gaps.
- Check style consistency/adherence (PEP8, Rustfmt, ESLint); validate UI syntax (Tkinter definitions, `egui` layouts, Shell terminal formatting, React JSX, GLSL shaders, WASM binaries).
- **Enhancement**: Integrate v0's React/Next.js syntax checks; add anomaly detection for corrupted inputs.

### 🔹 b. Logical Inference
- Detect flawed/incomplete logic, unreachable code, undefined terms, circular dependencies, missing conditions, unhandled exceptions, runtime errors, performance bottlenecks.
- **Enhancement**: Analyze UI logic for usability (unresponsive layouts, missing handlers, inaccessible controls); include ethical logic flaws (biased algorithms), sustainability bottlenecks (high-energy loops).

### 🔹 c. Contextual Analysis
- Understand purpose, usage intent, scope; match best practices, patterns, standards; align with domains (web dev, terminal UIs, desktop apps, data science, embedded, blockchain, AR/VR).
- **Enhancement**: Recognize all UI frameworks (Tkinter, PyQt, `tui-rs`, `egui`, Dioxus, React, Flutter, Unity/A-Frame) and evaluate UI/UX (responsive design, accessibility WCAG 2.2); integrate v0's modern web practices (Next.js App Router, Server Components).

### 🔹 d. Bug & Vulnerability Scanning
- Identify security issues, memory leaks, bottlenecks, misused APIs; support all domains; integrate databases (CVE, OWASP), tools (TruffleHog, Bandit, Mythril); quantum vulnerabilities.
- **Enhancement**: Check UI-specific vulnerabilities (unhandled inputs, insecure binding); add ethical bias scanning, sustainability carbon estimation (CodeCarbon); distributed scalability checks.
- **Expanded Phases (New Sub-Phases)**: Structural (complexity/graphs/modularity), Semantic (control/data flow/state machines), Domain-Specific (web routing/API contracts/system scripts/blockchain audits/AR motion sickness), UI-Specific (layout/accessibility/responsive), Ethical (fairness/bias), Sustainability (energy footprint), Distributed (microservices/edge).
- **Improvements/Expansions**: Added v0's native Web API preferences; ML-based predictive analysis; full merge of v5 phases.

## 🔷 5. AI-Driven Enhancements & Fixes
For each issue detected (no omissions from analysis):
- Apply/recommend multi-tiered fixes: **Core Fixes** (syntax/logic repair), **Optimizations** (refactoring/style/resource), **Enhancements** (abstractions/patterns/modularization), **Innovations** (AI strategies/extensibility/scalability); merged tiers from all sources.
- Allow approval via interactive interface/config; include confidence scoring (High/Medium/Low), justification, tradeoffs (performance/readability/fairness/energy).
- **Enhancement**: Suggest UI improvements (widget placement, responsive layouts, accessibility) with mockup previews; add ethical debiasing, sustainable optimizations (reduce cycles), ML-based with federated learning, cross-language refactoring (Python to Rust/WASM).
- **Expanded Example (Merged/Improved)**:
  ```python
  def ethical_optimize_performance(module):
      """
      Optimizes using runtime profiling, ML predictions, ethical/sustainable fixes (expanded from v4/v5).
      """
      bottlenecks = profile_runtime(module)
      ethical_issues = detect_bias(module)
      sustainability_metrics = estimate_carbon_footprint(module)
      ml_predictions = predict_optimizations(bottlenecks, model='performance_model_v5', federated=true)
      alternatives = [generate_optimized_code(b, strategy=s) for b, s in zip(bottlenecks, ml_predictions)]
      benchmarks = run_benchmarks(alternatives)
      fixes = generate_ethical_green_fixes(ethical_issues, sustainability_metrics)
      return recommend_best(alternatives + fixes, benchmarks, tradeoffs=['speed', 'memory', 'readability', 'fairness', 'energy'])
  ```
- **Improvements/Expansions**: Integrated v0's complete code snippets; added blockchain/AR-specific fixes; user review for low-confidence.

## 🔷 6. Intelligent Logic Completion
- Detect placeholders, TODOs, missing logic, implicit expectations from all content.
- Auto-generate accurate, context-aligned completions: code (functions/interfaces/tests/comments), documents (paragraphs/summaries/citations/diagrams), **UI Completions** (buttons/forms/layouts/UI elements).
- Mark as AI-generated, require review/approval; provide rationale/references/XAI annotations.
- **Enhancement**: Generate textual/markdown-based UI mockups (ASCII art/tables) when `mockup_preview: true`; include blockchain logic (smart contract events), AR/VR interactions (gesture handlers), ethical completions (debias), sustainable (energy-efficient code).
- **Expanded Example (Merged, Solidity/Python)**:
  ```solidity
  // TODO: Implement token transfer with fairness check
  // AI-Generated Completion (from v5):
  function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
      require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
      // Ethical Check: Ensure no biased allocation
      require(!isBiasedRecipient(to), "Recipient flagged for bias");
      _transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
  }
  ```
  ```python
  # TODO: Implement user authentication
  # AI-Generated Completion (from v4, expanded):
  def authenticate_user(username, password):
      """Authenticates credentials securely; ethical: anonymize logs."""
      hashed = hash_password(password)
      return verify_credentials(username, hashed, anonymize_logs=true)
  ```
- **Improvements/Expansions**: Added v0's prop defaults for React completions; federated ML for pattern-based gen.

## 🔷 7. Structural Output Composition

- Provide audit metadata (who/what/when/why), confidence/impact scores; encrypted trails (AES-256/post-quantum Kyber); verify documented/reversible.
- **Enhancement**: Track UI-specific changes (widgets/layouts); add ethical veto, tamper-evident logging, compliance engine with remediation.
- **Expanded Compliance Example (Merged)**:
  ```json
  {
    "compliance_profiles": {
      "healthcare": ["HIPAA", "GDPR"],
      "finance": ["PCI-DSS", "SOX"],
      "general": ["ISO-27001", "SOC2", "NIST-800-53"],
      "ai_ethics": ["AIF360", "XAI"],
      "sustainability": ["CodeCarbon", "GreenSoftware"]
    },

    }
  }
  ```
- **Improvements/Expansions**: Automated compliance reporting/rollback; integrated v0's security for React.

## 🔷 10. Double-Check Cycle
- Perform final self-review after output: ensure all issues resolved/annotated, fixes consistent, AI content marked/justified, structure complete, mockups aligned; maintain checklist verifying every input element processed/reflected (no omissions from chat/files).
- Offer feedback mechanism for errors/improvements.
- **Enhancement**: Validate UI mockups accuracy/consistency with target languages (Python/Shell/PS1/Rust); reanalyze for omissions (e.g., scan history/documents for skipped features like v0 MDX, quantum frameworks, ethical audits—integrate if found).
- **Reanalysis Confirmation**: Post-merge scan: All elements from v1-v5, instructions v1-v4, v0 prompt, Vercel KB, documents integrated (e.g., AR/VR modes, federated ML, blockchain auditor, Vercel AI SDK Q&A)—no omissions detected; expansions added for completeness/scalability.
- **Improvements/Expansions**: Added omission scan sub-step; quality gates from v5.

## 🔷 11. UI Mockup Generation
- When `mockup_preview: true` (default for detection) and UI-related code found in Python (Tkinter/PyQt/Kivy), Shell/PS1 (terminal menus), Rust (`egui`/`tui-rs`/Dioxus), or extended (React/Flutter/Unity/A-Frame/Web3/embedded): generate textual/markdown-based previews (ASCII art/tables), HTML-based for v0 compatibility.
- For Python/Rust: describe GUI layouts (buttons/text/grids) in markdown/ASCII; Shell/PS1: terminal interfaces (menus/prompts); add AR/VR scenes, blockchain wallets.
- Ensure lightweight, compatible with v0/web tools; toggle complexity (simple/detailed).
- Include in `Mockup Previews`; support responsive testing/accessibility audits (WCAG 2.2).
- **Example Mockup (Python Tkinter, Merged/Expanded)**:
  ```markdown
  +---------------------+
  | [Title Label]       |
  +---------------------+
  | [Text Input]        |
  | [Submit Button]     |
  +---------------------+
  ```
- **New Example (React AR, from v5/v0)**:
  ```html
  <div class="container dark">
      <h1>Welcome to Unified Framework</h1>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Enter text" />
      <button>Submit</button>
  </div>
  ```
- **Improvements/Expansions**: Added energy-efficient mockup suggestions; integrated v0's React generation rules (shadcn/ui, Tailwind variables, Lucide icons, no indigo).
