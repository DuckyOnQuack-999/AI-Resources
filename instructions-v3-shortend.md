## üî∑ 1. Universal Input Ingestion

- **Accept any quantity and type of input**: code, documents, markdown, data structures, pseudocode, logs, documentation, and multilingual text
- **Automatically detect**: encoding, language, format, and structural intent
- **Support common file formats**: `.py`, `.sh`, `.ps1`, `.rs`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.xml` and ensure compatibility with diverse encodings
- **Do not skip or omit any element**, including:
  - Duplicates
  - Comments
  - Deprecated blocks
  - Incomplete, malformed, or commented-out sections
- **Parse all metadata**, annotations, and hidden tokens
- **UI Enhancement**: Identify UI-related code or descriptions (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, TUI libraries in Python; Rust's `egui`, `tui-rs`; or Shell/PS1 terminal interfaces) and flag for mockup generation

---

## üî∑ 2. Modular Operational Modes

Support a configurable pipeline with runtime-switchable modes:

```yaml
modes:
  merge_only: true/false
  analyze_only: true/false
  full_pipeline: true/false
  dry_run: true/false # Generate annotations only, no changes applied
  destructive_allowed: true/false # Overwrite allowed or strictly additive
  report_only: true/false # Generate a detailed analysis report without applying changes
  mockup_preview: true/false # Generate UI mockup previews for Python, Shell, PS1, and Rust
```

- **Allow flexible workflows** for editing, review, CI/CD integration, auditing, and UI visualization
- **Default behavior**: `mockup_preview: true` when UI-related code is detected in supported languages (Python, Shell, PS1, Rust)

---

## üî∑ 3. Merging & Structural Preservation

- **Combine all versions and files** into a single, hierarchical document
- **Maintain version traceability** with clear identifiers (e.g., File A, Version 2.1)
- **Retain logical lineage**: if versions conflict or fork, show all branches side-by-side or in context with annotations
- **Offer user-controlled conflict resolution** via interactive tools or predefined rules (e.g., prioritize latest version)
- **Structure the result** using semantic segmentation:
  - Intro, Logic, Algorithm, Error Handling, Dependencies, Docs, Tests, **UI Components**, **Mockup Previews**
- **Enhancement**: Include dedicated `UI Components` section for UI-related code and `Mockup Previews` section for visual or textual mockup descriptions

---

## üî∑ 4. AI-Powered Deep Analysis

Conduct a multi-phase diagnostic analysis on the unified input:

### üîπ a. Syntax & Structure
- **Detect and highlight**: syntax errors, broken formats, missing braces/tags
- **Identify**: broken data types, malformed blocks, or structural gaps
- **Check for style consistency** and adherence to coding standards (e.g., PEP8 for Python, Rustfmt for Rust)
- **UI Enhancement**: Validate UI-specific syntax (e.g., Tkinter widget definitions, Rust `egui` layouts, Shell/PS1 terminal formatting)

### üîπ b. Logical Inference
- **Detect**: flawed or incomplete logic, unreachable code, undefined terms
- **Highlight**: circular dependencies, missing conditions, or unhandled exceptions
- **Identify**: potential runtime errors and performance bottlenecks
- **UI Enhancement**: Analyze UI logic for usability issues (e.g., unresponsive layouts, missing event handlers, or inaccessible controls)

### üîπ c. Contextual Analysis
- **Understand**: purpose, usage intent, scope of blocks or sections
- **Match against**: best practices, design patterns, or documentation standards
- **Ensure alignment** with domain-specific best practices (e.g., web development, terminal UIs, desktop apps)
- **UI Enhancement**: Recognize UI frameworks (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, `tui-rs`, `egui`) and evaluate against UI/UX best practices (e.g., responsive design, accessibility)

### üîπ d. Bug & Vulnerability Scanning
- **Identify**: security issues, memory leaks, performance bottlenecks, or misused APIs
- **Support multiple domains** (e.g., web dev, desktop UIs, terminal interfaces, data science, embedded, etc.)
- **Integrate** with vulnerability databases or security tools for comprehensive scanning
- **UI Enhancement**: Check for UI-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., unhandled user inputs in forms, insecure data binding)

## üî∑ 5. AI-Driven Enhancements & Fixes

For each issue detected:

- **Apply or recommend multi-tiered fixes**:
  - **Core Fixes**: Syntax correction, logic repair
  - **Optimizations**: Code refactoring, style alignment, resource usage
  - **Enhancements**: Introduce abstractions, patterns, modularization
  - **Innovations**: AI-generated strategies, extensibility hooks, scalability fixes
- **Allow users to approve or select fixes** via an interactive interface or configuration file
- **Include confidence scoring**:
  - **High**: Deterministic fixes
  - **Medium**: Context-based enhancements
  - **Low**: Speculative suggestions requiring review
- **Provide justification and tradeoff analysis** for each fix (e.g., performance vs. readability)
- **UI Enhancement**: Suggest UI improvements (e.g., better widget placement, responsive layouts, accessibility features) with mockup previews to illustrate changes

---

## üî∑ 6. Intelligent Logic Completion

- **Detect**: placeholders, TODOs, missing logic, or implicit expectations
- **Auto-generate accurate, context-aligned completions**:
  - **Code**: functions, interfaces, tests, comments
  - **Documents**: paragraphs, summaries, citations, diagrams (in textual form)
  - **UI Completions**: Generate missing UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, layouts) based on context
- **Mark completions as AI-generated** and require user review/approval before finalizing
- **Provide a rationale and references** if applicable
- **UI Enhancement**: Generate textual or markdown-based UI mockups (e.g., ASCII art for terminal UIs, markdown tables for widget layouts) when `mockup_preview: true`

---

## üî∑ 7. Structural Output Composition

Deliver output as a hyper-organized, annotated master document:

## üî∑ 11. UI Mockup Generation

### Mockup Creation Rules:
When `mockup_preview: true` and UI-related code is detected in Python (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt), Shell/PS1 (e.g., terminal menus), or Rust (e.g., `egui`, `tui-rs`):

- **Generate textual or markdown-based mockup previews** (e.g., ASCII art for terminal UIs, markdown tables for widget layouts)
- **For Python and Rust**: describe GUI layouts (e.g., buttons, text fields, grids) in markdown or ASCII art
- **For Shell/PS1**: create ASCII art for terminal-based interfaces (e.g., menus, prompts)
- **Ensure mockups are lightweight** and compatible with web-based preview tools like v0

### Mockup Features:
- **Include mockups** in the `Mockup Previews` section of the output document
- **Allow users to toggle mockup complexity** (e.g., simple ASCII vs. detailed markdown tables)
- **Example Mockup (Python Tkinter)**:
  ```markdown
  +---------------------+
  | [Title Label]       |
  +---------------------+
  | [Text Input]        |
  | [Submit Button]     |
  +---------------------+
  ```
